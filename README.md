# miscr

`miscr` (Micro-Controller Interfaced Stepper Control with RAMPS) aims to be a simple stepper controller, also including features such as Bluetooth and SD-Card loading, a simple G-Code interpreter, LCD screen support, calibration and more. It’s not meant to be a complicated, professional piece of software for controlling steppers for a CNC environment, however, will be something simple to tinker with.

**I don’t intend to implement extruder support any time soon...**

This is currently still a concept, however, with this project, I wanted to demonstrate that I could write my own simple controller firmware.
