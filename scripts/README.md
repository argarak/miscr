# Shell Scripts

These are scripts which I use in my current setup. The `client.sh` script is run whenever I want to upload any updated firmware, and the `host.sh` script is run on the server machine which will build the firmware and upload in to my Arduino MEGA. You may use these scripts if you like, however they are not necessary if you have a different setup to mine.
